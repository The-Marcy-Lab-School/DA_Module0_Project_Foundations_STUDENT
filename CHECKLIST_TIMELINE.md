# Checklist & Timeline — 2 Days

This first project is intentionally short: 2 focused days, not a full week.
This is a **suggested pace, not a rigid schedule**, and every item below is
also the actual submission checklist — work through it in order (it matters
here, see the ⚠️ below), don't just treat it as a list to shuffle.

> A note on this: for this first project, we're handing you a ready-made
> timeline because you're still getting oriented to the whole workflow. As
> you move through the program, you'll be expected to plan your own
> pacing — later projects may ask you to set up your own tracking instead of
> working from a timeline someone else wrote for you. Treat this one as a
> model of what breaking a project into checkpoints looks like, not just a
> checklist to follow on autopilot.

This project doesn't involve writing code — every step below is a terminal
command you run and record, not a program you write.

## Day 1 — Environment setup, raw look, first commits

- [ ] Terminal, Git, GitHub account, and VS Code installed/ready.
- [ ] Repo created from the template via **"Use this template"** (not Fork)
  and cloned locally — see `README.md`.
- [ ] Your own `.gitignore` created (a few real lines, not copy-pasted blind)
  and a `LICENSE` chosen.
- [ ] `field_notes.md`'s "Setup log" section opened and started — log
  commands as you go, in fenced code blocks tagged `bash`, not reconstructed
  from memory later.
- [ ] Confirm `data/co2_emissions_2022.csv` is present — included in the
  template, everyone uses this same file.
- [ ] Look at the raw CSV as plain text **before running any column-preview
  commands** (`field_notes.md` section 1 — which command to use for this is
  part of what's being tested, so it isn't named here).
  > ⚠️ Common mistake: listing column names without ever actually opening and
  > looking at the raw data first.
- [ ] Jot down what you notice from the raw look (section 1).
- [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "add gitignore and license"`, then
  `git commit -m "add raw data"` — don't wait until everything's done to
  commit for the first time.
- [ ] Find and log a command that shows just the column names, then a
  command that previews real values for at least 5 of the 6 columns
  (sections 2-3) — paste the real output you got, not values you're
  assuming.
  > ⚠️ Common mistake: misclassifying an ID-like or ZIP-code-like column as a
  > true numeric variable.
- [ ] Answer, in your own words: what's the actual difference between a
  list/array and a table? (section 3)
- [ ] State whether the dataset is structured or unstructured, with a reason
  (section 4).
- [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "add column-type notes"` — this is commit #2,
  the MVP bar is met once this lands, but keep going.
  > ⚠️ Common mistake: committing everything in one big "final" commit
  > instead of showing incremental progress.

**Exit criterion:** at least 2 real commits pushed to GitHub by end of day —
`git log --oneline` should already tell a real story, not be empty.

## Day 2 — Reflections, polish, submit

- [ ] Find and log the commands that answer section 5's two counting
  questions (real output pasted, not assumed), then list **at least 2**
  things you'd want to know about how this dataset was collected before
  trusting it.
- [ ] Turn the most specific/checkable of those into one real data-quality
  question for the source (section 6). *(Answers will vary.)*
  > ⚠️ Common mistake: a vague question like "is this data good?" — if the
  > data's maintainer couldn't actually answer it with something concrete,
  > it's not specific enough.
- [ ] Write a **separate** question — something you're genuinely curious to
  explore using this data, not another data-quality check (section 7).
  *(Answers will vary.)*
- [ ] AI-literacy reflection: 2 concrete risks of trusting unverified AI
  output, plus one specific personal rule for double-checking AI-provided
  facts (section 8). *(Answers will vary.)*
  > ⚠️ Common mistake: a rule too vague to actually follow, like "I'll be
  > careful."
- [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "add reflection"`.
- [ ] Setup log has real commands from throughout the project (not just a
  token line), each in a fenced code block tagged `bash`; section 9 includes
  a real error (or unexpected result) and how you diagnosed it.
  > ⚠️ Common mistake: a vague or generic-sounding note that could've been
  > written without actually hitting it.
- [ ] Update `README.md`: what the dataset is, its license/source, and a
  one-line pointer to your data-quality question.
- [ ] Final push to GitHub — confirm the repo is actually **public** (open
  it in a private/incognito browser window to check).
- [ ] Self-check against this checklist before calling it done.

**Exit criterion:** everything above is done and pushed. That's the whole
submission — this project doesn't have a separate above-and-beyond phase
built into the 2-day pace; if you finish with real time left over, see
below.

## After Day 2: peer field-notes review

Once everyone's submitted, there's a separate session where parts of your
`field_notes.md` get shared **anonymously** with a small group of peers —
you'll all compare reasoning against the *same* dataset (everyone used
the same file this project), give each other real feedback, and see where
your column-type calls and reflections agreed or didn't. No prep needed
beyond having a real, finished `field_notes.md` — just know it's coming.

## Above & Beyond

Only the additional items — everything above still applies and isn't
repeated here. All four are detailed in `ABOVE_AND_BEYOND.md`; none require
writing code except the last, which gives you the code to run.

- [ ] Chain terminal commands (`|`, `&&`) to answer a real question about the
  dataset that a single command couldn't.
- [ ] Find the min and max of a numeric column.
- [ ] Do the AI-command-approval exercise for real: ask an AI assistant for a
  terminal command, explain what it does, flag anything destructive, and
  make an actual approve/modify/reject call.
- [ ] Use a real branch + merge for one piece of this work instead of
  committing straight to `main`.
- [ ] Run the given-code Module 1 preview (`preview.py`) and compare it to
  your own manual column-type table.
