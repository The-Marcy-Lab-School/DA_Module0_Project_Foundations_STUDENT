# Foundations Project: Data Literacy Field Notes

**New here?** Start with `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for what you're building and
why. This file (`README.md`) is where the step-by-step setup lives — you're
already in the right place.

**Due:** 2 days (this first project is intentionally short — a couple of
focused days right after this module's content phase, not a full week, since
it's meant to get you moving, not to be a big lift). See
`CHECKLIST_TIMELINE.md` for a suggested day-by-day pace and the full
submission checklist.

This repo is a **GitHub template** — a starting point, not something you edit
directly on Marcy's copy of it. This is the first project of the whole
program, so this doc assumes you've never done any of this before. Everyone
in this cohort is on **macOS** — these directions only cover that, on
purpose, so there's no cross-platform noise to wade through.

## Getting started

### Step 1: Get your own copy

On this repo's GitHub page, you'll see two buttons that both sound like "make
a copy" but do different things:

- **"Use this template"** ← use this one. It creates a brand-new, independent
  repository under *your* GitHub account, with no visible link back to this
  template. That's what you want for something that becomes part of your
  portfolio.
- **"Fork"** — creates a copy that stays linked to this one (GitHub will show
  "forked from marcy-lab-school/..." on your repo forever). Fork is the right
  tool when you intend to contribute changes back to the original project —
  that's not this. Don't use Fork here.

Click **"Use this template" → "Create a new repository,"** name it something
like `data-literacy-field-notes`, keep it **public** (the assignment requires
a public repo), and create it.

### Step 2: Set up your tools

Tools for this module (all free):

- **Terminal** — already on your Mac (Applications → Utilities → Terminal, or
  `Cmd+Space` and type "Terminal").
- **Git** — check if it's already installed: open Terminal and run `git
  --version`. If it's not installed, macOS will prompt you to install the
  Xcode Command Line Tools — accept that prompt.
- **GitHub** — free tier, unlimited public repos. Create an account if you
  don't have one.
- **VS Code** — download from https://code.visualstudio.com (the macOS
  `.dmg` build), drag it into Applications. You'll use it to edit Markdown
  files and open a terminal — not to write or run any code this project.

### Step 3: Clone your new repo locally

Open **Terminal** (`Cmd+Space`, type "Terminal," hit Enter). On your own new
repo's page (not this template), click the green **Code** button, copy the
HTTPS URL, then:

```bash
git clone <the URL you copied>
cd <your-repo-name>
```

### Step 4: Set up your environment yourself

This module is literally about learning git, GitHub, and the terminal — so
unlike some later projects, this template does **not** come with a
`.gitignore` or a `LICENSE` already made. Building them is part of the
assignment, not busywork:

- **Create a `.gitignore`.** From the terminal: `touch .gitignore`, then open
  it in VS Code and add a few lines for files Python/Jupyter projects
  shouldn't track — think about what actually shouldn't go in version control
  (compiled files, checkpoint files your notebook editor creates
  automatically, OS-generated files like `.DS_Store`). Don't just copy a
  `.gitignore` from somewhere — write the 3-4 lines that apply to *this*
  project, so you understand what each one is for.
- **Choose a `LICENSE`.** Since this repo is going public, add a license so
  it's clear what others can do with your code. MIT is a common, simple
  default for a personal project — see https://choosealicense.com if you want
  to understand the tradeoffs before picking.
- **Make your first commit.** Once you've added those two files:
  ```bash
  git add .gitignore LICENSE
  git commit -m "add gitignore and license"
  git push
  ```

You should already have `git init`-equivalent setup from cloning (cloning
sets up the local repo and connects the remote for you) — if you're not sure
`git status` and `git remote -v` both work cleanly in this folder, that's the
first thing to check before moving on.

### Writing bash commands (you'll need this)

Anywhere in this project you write down a terminal command — in
`starter/field_notes.md`, this file, anywhere — write it in a **fenced code
block tagged `bash`**, like this:

````
```bash
git status
```
````

Three backticks, the word `bash`, your command, three backticks to close.
This is the standard way commands are shown in any real README or docs
site — it renders with syntax highlighting and makes the command
copy-pasteable, instead of just sitting in a paragraph as plain text.

## Dataset

Everyone in this cohort uses the same dataset — already included at
`data/co2_emissions_2022.csv`, no download needed. It's a small, curated
slice (254 rows, 6 columns, the year 2022) of OWID's full public CO2 and
Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset. See `data/SOURCE.md` for exactly how it
was derived and its license (CC BY 4.0, Our World in Data).

Don't substitute a different dataset — using the same one across the cohort
keeps everyone's grading consistent and means classmates can actually compare
notes on what they found.

## What to do

See `starter/field_notes.md` — one file for everything: every section tells
you which terminal command to run, and you fill in the real output you got
plus your answer, starting from a setup log at the top and ending with a
real error you hit along the way (start filling it in from Step 1, don't
reconstruct it at the end). It's where you log commands as you actually run
them, not reconstructed from memory at the end. `CHECKLIST_TIMELINE.md` has
the suggested pace across the 2 days and the full step-by-step checklist.
Your instructor shares the grading rubric separately through the
classroom — not this repo.

Along the way, you're going to hit at least one confusing terminal error —
everyone does. When it happens: read the error message, don't just retype
the command hoping it works. That's exactly what section 9 of
`starter/field_notes.md` is for.

**Where's the exact bar for "done," and what are the optional stretch
goals?** This repo (your own copy) doesn't include `MVP.md` or
`ABOVE_AND_BEYOND.md` on purpose — they're not something to keep sitting in
your portfolio repo. Ask your instructor for the link to this template's
`project-scope` branch (it'll look like `.../tree/project-scope` on the
*template's* GitHub page, not your own copy) to read them, or check the
checklist your instructor shares through the classroom, which covers the
same ground.
