# Data Literacy Field Notes & Terminal Log

**The setup:** You're a new data analyst, and this dataset just landed with
zero documentation. Before anyone can trust an analysis built on top of it,
you need to figure out what's actually in it — what each column really
holds, and anything that looks off. That's what this whole file walks
through: the real, everyday first pass any analyst runs on an unfamiliar
file.

Dataset: `../data/co2_emissions_2022.csv` (see `../data/SOURCE.md`). Each
section below describes what you're trying to find out — **figuring out
which command (and which flags) actually gets you there is part of what
this project tests**, so the exact command isn't given. Where a command
belongs, you'll see a `# TODO:` comment describing the goal instead of a
ready-to-run command; replace the comment with the real command you used.
Paste the **real output** you got underneath, then write your answer based
on what you actually saw, not what you'd expect. Work through this in
order; open the raw file before anything else.

Run all commands from the repo root, or `cd` into `data/` first and drop the
`data/` prefix — your choice, just be consistent.

**This one file is your whole record** — the commands you ran, their real
output, and your written answers, all together in the order you actually
did the work. There's no separate log file to keep in sync with this one;
whenever you write a command down anywhere in this file, use a fenced code
block tagged `bash`, like this:

````
```bash
git status
```
````

Three backticks, the word `bash`, your command, three backticks to close —
it renders with syntax highlighting and makes the command copy-pasteable.

## Setup log

Before jumping into the dataset, log the commands you actually ran to set
this repo up (see `GETTING_STARTED.md`) — `git init`/clone, creating your
`.gitignore` and `LICENSE`, your first commit. Add to this as you go, don't
reconstruct it from memory at the end.

```bash
# TODO: the commands you actually ran to set up this repo
```

## 1. First look at the raw file

Before trusting anything about this file's structure, you want a quick,
safe peek at it — not the whole 254-row file, just the **first 5 lines**,
enough to see the shape of it without scrolling past everything.

```bash
# TODO: a command that prints just the first 5 lines of the raw file
```

**Output:**
_TODO: paste what you actually got_

**What I notice:** _TODO — your raw observations, in your own words_

## 2. Column names

Next you want to see just the column names by themselves — one per line is
a lot easier to scan than one long comma-separated row.

```bash
# TODO: a command (or combination of commands) that prints just the header
# row, one column name per line
```

**Output:**
_TODO_

## 3. Column-by-column data type table

For each column, you want to preview real values — **the first 6 values**
of just that one column — without scrolling through every field on every
row. Column numbers for reference: `country`=1, `iso_code`=2, `year`=3,
`population`=4, `gdp`=5, `co2`=6.

```bash
# TODO: a command that prints the first 6 values from a single column
# (repeat this for at least 5 of the 6 columns, swapping in each column's number)
```

Fill in the table from what you actually saw — not a guess from the column
name alone:

| Column | Inferred type | How I can tell |
|---|---|---|
| _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ |
| _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ |
| _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ |
| _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ |
| _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ |

**In your own words:** what's the actual difference between a list/array
and a table? (Not a definition you looked up — explain it the way you'd
explain it to a friend who's never coded. No command needed for this one,
just think about the table you just filled in above.)

_TODO_

## 4. Structured or unstructured?

State whether this dataset is structured or unstructured, and why.

_TODO_

## 5. Before you trust this data

Your first look (see section 1) turned up a row with a suspiciously
**blank** `iso_code`. Before you build anything on this data, you want to
know exactly how many of the 254 rows share that blank — is it a one-off,
or a real pattern worth flagging before anyone draws conclusions from it?
You may need more than one command for this — piping (`|`) feeds one
command's output into the next as input.

```bash
# TODO: a command (or combination) that counts how many rows have a
# BLANK iso_code
```

**Output:**
_TODO_

```bash
# TODO: the same idea, but for the gdp column
```

**Output:**
_TODO_

List **at least 2** specific things you'd want to know about how this
dataset was collected, before trusting any conclusion drawn from it — ground
at least one in the counts you just found.

**My 2 concerns:**
1. _TODO_
2. _TODO_

## 6. Data-quality question for the source

Take the **most specific and checkable** of the two concerns above, and
phrase it as a real question you'd send to the data's source/maintainer. A
good test: could they actually answer it with a concrete yes/no or fact —
not "is this data good?"

_TODO_

## 7. Something you're actually curious about

Different question from #6 — that one was about checking the data's
trustworthiness. This one's about you: what's something you're genuinely
curious to explore using this data? Pick two specific countries you're
curious to compare, and look up their full rows.

```bash
# TODO: a command that finds a specific country's row by name (repeat for
# a second country of your choice)
```

**Output:**
_TODO_

**My question:** _TODO_

## 8. AI-literacy reflection

Name **2 concrete risks** of trusting an AI assistant's output about this
dataset (or any data question) without checking it yourself. Then state
**one specific personal rule** for when you'll double-check an AI-provided
fact before relying on it professionally — specific enough that you could
actually follow it, not "I'll be careful."

**Risks:**
1. _TODO_
2. _TODO_

**My rule:** _TODO_

## 9. Something that went wrong (and how you figured it out)

Somewhere in this project you're going to run a command that either throws
an error or gives you output that isn't what you expected — everyone hits
this at least once. Paste the actual command and what actually happened
(not a paraphrase), then explain what that told you and how it led to the
fix — not "I googled it and it worked."

```bash
# TODO: a command that errored, or gave you unexpected results
```

**What happened:**
_TODO: the actual error message, or the unexpected output you got_

**What it told me and how I fixed it:** _TODO_
